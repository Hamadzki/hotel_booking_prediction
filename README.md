# 🏨 Hotel Booking Prediction

## 📜 Project Overview
This project aims to predict hotel bookings using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can forecast hotel booking outcomes based on various features and data points. The project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature encoding, handling outliers, and evaluating feature importance.
